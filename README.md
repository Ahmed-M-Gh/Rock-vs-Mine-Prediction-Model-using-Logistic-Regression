# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-Model-using-Logistic-Regression
This code builds a machine learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict whether a sonar signal is generated by a rock or a mine. The model is based on sonar data consisting of 60 numerical features collected using ultrasonic waves.
